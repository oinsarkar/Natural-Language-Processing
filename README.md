# The project explores the alignment between news media and social media discourse by performing topic modeling on two datasets: the HuffPost news dataset and the Twitter dataset. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we identified dominant topics and associated keywords in both datasets, enabling us to compare the thematic structures of news articles and social media posts. The extracted topics from each source were then analyzed for alignment using cosine similarity to measure the degree of overlap between the two mediums. This comparative analysis sheds light on how closely social media discourse reflects traditional news narratives. Additionally, as a supplementary contribution, we developed a text classification model capable of categorizing news articles into predefined categories. This dual approach of topic modeling and classification not only examines thematic alignment but also offers a practical tool for organizing news data, adding value to the projectâ€™s analytical and application-oriented goals.
